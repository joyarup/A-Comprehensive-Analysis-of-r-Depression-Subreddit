# Online Mental Health Community Analysis

## Project Overview
Authored by Arup Sarkar, this project presents a comprehensive analysis of the r/Depression subreddit, using a dual-faceted approach involving Natural Language Processing (NLP) and network analysis to explore user dynamics and comment classification within the community.

## Introduction
The project focuses on dissecting user interactions within r/Depression, classifying comments indicative of depressive states using NLP techniques, and analyzing the network of user engagements within and beyond the subreddit.

## Data Fetching and Preprocessing
Utilizing Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW), the project involves data retrieval and preprocessing to ensure dataset integrity, including handling missing values and duplicate entries.

## Data Analysis
- Analysis of author posts in r/Depression and their engagement in other subreddits.
- Network analysis using NetworkX to visualize connections between subreddits based on author interactions.
- Exploration of common interests and engagements of users across multiple online communities.

## Methodology and Application of Machine Learning
- Application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Count Vectorizer for NLP.
- Use of RandomForest, LSTM with RNN, and NaiveBayes models for depression classification in comments.
- Performance metrics of the models are discussed with insights into their effectiveness.

## Conclusion
This project offers a unique perspective on the online mental health community, particularly focusing on the r/Depression subreddit, and provides insights into the interconnectedness of online spaces and user behaviors.
